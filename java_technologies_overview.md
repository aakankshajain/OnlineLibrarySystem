##Spring 4.0
================
#Why used : 
It is a MVC framework used to develop web application.

#Technologies replaced by Spring : 
Struts,EJB

#Why preffered over older technologies : 
Spring does not restrict to jsp as view technolgy.It provides good integration of other technologies as well.
Spring does not have any depency on any application servers.So we can switch from one server to another easily.
Spring also provide web services which are provided by web servers if we use EJBs.So dont require to use web-servers explicitly.Spring provides the facility.
